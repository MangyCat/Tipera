# Tipera - Type Tester

This typing game was made in **2 hours** for High Seas. It is a typing game where you choose between quotes or dictionary words to type and get your results at the end.

## How to Play

1. Go to the online demo [Tipera](https://mangycat.github.io/Tipera).
2. Click "Quotes" or "Dictionary".
3. Start typing the text. It will start timing you, so be quick!
4. You'll receive your WPM (Words Per Minute) and time. (I got up to 117 WPM!)
5. Restart the game by clicking one of the buttons again.
## Features

- **Dictionary Mode:** Selects 20 random words from a built-in list of 500 simple English words. (hardest word is xylophone)
- **Quote Mode:** Selects a random quote from a built-in list of 70 motivational quotes.
- **Built-in WPM and Time Score:** Shows your WPM and the time it took for you to type out all the words.
- **Error Detection:** Marks incorrectly typed words in red and won't let you proceed until you've typed them all correctly.
